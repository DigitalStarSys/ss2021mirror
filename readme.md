# secret sky 2021 client mirror

copied from `stream.secretskyfest.com`, i make no claim to ownership and will remove if requested. view at [ss2021mirror.github.io](https://ss2021mirror.github.io) or clone and host locally.

modified to run offline (originals uploaded as `app.js.old`). video-related functionality broken. ~~will still connect to the official websocket as long as it's up, and most multiplayer interaction works.~~ the server seems to be down now. still works, but it's a bit lonely ðŸ˜­

contact me `u/asentientbot` or `@asentientbot` if you have questions.
