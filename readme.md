# notes!!

hi! we tried to get this working, but alas, we couldn't. we're not sure if this repo is up-to-date, but it was the one we were able to find. we've noticed some strange behaviors, so here are some of our personal notes. YMMV, feel free to contribute.

- the current version hosted is **1:1** with the original archive we had, save for the .git folder.
- even if you replace the original secret sky youtube id, it doesn't load. this might be for mobile devices only, but we couldn't get this to load on our iphone.
- sometimes browsers just don't let you in. we've only had consistent success with safari on our macbook air, but we've seen it work on firefox for macOS on our partner's laptop, and *once* on firefox for windows on our PC.
- you might need an hls stream source to get video to work? there's stuff that pertains to it (notably mentions of some dead M3U8s) in worlds/hlshelper/assets/js/app.js 

we couldn't figure this out, although we were able to otherwise still explore the auditorium again, just very silently. feel free to explore or try and mess with this. it's not our archive work, though, so the original readme is down below this.

copied from `stream.secretskyfest.com`, i make no claim to ownership and will remove if requested. view at [ss2021mirror.github.io](https://ss2021mirror.github.io) or clone and host locally.

modified to run offline (originals uploaded as `app.js.old`). video-related functionality broken. ~~will still connect to the official websocket as long as it's up, and most multiplayer interaction works.~~ the server seems to be down now. still works, but it's a bit lonely ðŸ˜­
